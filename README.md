# FALLMON
A remake of a old project I've made 3 years ago, originated from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/491386652/).
# Building
* Download [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.1-stable/) (Since that's what I used to make this, and some code may not work too well on newer/older versions. Idk maybe)
* Download this source
* Open Godot and click 'Import'
* Find the game's project file (project.godot)
* Open the file
